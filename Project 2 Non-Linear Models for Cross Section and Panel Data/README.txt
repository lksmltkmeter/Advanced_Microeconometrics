README

For the second project on nonlinear models, the students were provided with a panel datasets of N = 209 countries over T = 299 days covering the first 10 months of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The overarching research question of this empirical project was: What is the expected development in COVID-19 deaths due to the seasonal changes in temperature? 

Students had to 
1) Pick an estimation sample and a set of additional covariates and justify the decision. 
2) Estimate non-linear models namely a Tobit model and a Poisson regression model
3) Assess the fit of the two models
4) Assess the robustness with respect to the assumed distribution for the error term
5) Evaluate whether the effect of temperature on COVID-19 deaths is constant across countries and over time. Are some countries likely to see sharper increases in fatalities over the coming months?

Main file produced by students: P2_main_file_18.12.mlx 

Files partly produced by students: All Tobit.m or Poisson.m modules. Students had to complete the critical "predict" and "criterion" functions.

Auxiliare files provided by professor: hessian.m, jacobianest.m, and others
