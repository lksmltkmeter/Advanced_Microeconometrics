README

This repo documents the code used for the assignment projects of the course "Advanced Microeconometrics" at the University of Copenhagen (see: https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a√òka08084u/) taught by Anders Munk-Nielsen. The project deliverables (pdf report + Matlab code) were produced as a group together by Malte Rattenborg, Felix Heuer and Lukas Malte Kemeter. 

Each problem set is split into two party, a mathematical econometrics exercise (proofs) and an empirical part for which data was provided and code had to be produced.

Each of the three projects is represented by one folder. Each project folder contains a separate README file. Due to the complexity of the matter, the teaching professor supplied each group with some pre-written but incomplete code and functions on which the students have to build on. The project README files will try to specify what code was produced by the students and what the focus area was.
